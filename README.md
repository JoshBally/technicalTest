Executives Place - technical test

Not sure how you wanted the database to be setup.
I have only ever connected to a database before that is on a server, so I made a new database on my server and have connected to that. You might have a problem running the script because your ip address is not whitelisted to use remote connection on my server for MySQL. I have whitelisted the domains ezekia.com and notactivelylooking.com but I am not sure if that will work. If you provide the ip address you are using I can whitelist it so that it will be able use the database, but I can understand if you do not wish to share that. So I will also make a video of what happens on my computer when I run the script to show what is supposed to happen.
